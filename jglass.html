                <li>Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) during its AGM showcased <b>a new Mixed Reality solution</b>, called Jio Glass. At the event, the company did not reveal the pricing and the availability details about the product. However, they did showcase a demo as to how the Jio Glass will work when it is made available to the public.</li>
                <br>    
                <li>The company has said that it will come with 25 in-built apps to allow augmented reality video meetings and more. Furthermore, it mentioned that the product will take advantage of 5G services, which Jio is currently working on. Jio will start testing its 5G services as soon as the spectrum sales are finished.</li>
                <br>
                <li>RIL has partnered with Google for its Jio products, which means that both the companies will be able to collaborate with each other and develop the product. To recall, Google in the past had a similar product it was working on, called the Google Glass, however, it did not pan out and never went on sale.</li>
